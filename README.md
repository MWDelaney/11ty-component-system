# Eleventy Component System

## Single-file front-end components for Eleventy sites

This example project shows how to use the Eleventy Component System to create reusable *single-file* components in your Eleventy site.

## Why use the Eleventy Component System?

* Autmaticaally generate a [git-based content management](https://decapcms.org) system for your components.
* Start building pages with components right away!

## Who is this for?

### WordPress developers

* You don't need 90% of WordPress's features, but you do need a way to create and manage content with reusable components.
* Hosting and databases are expensive; most of your content is static and doesn't need to be stored in a database.
